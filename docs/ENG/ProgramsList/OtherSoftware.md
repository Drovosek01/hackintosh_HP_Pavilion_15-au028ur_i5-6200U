### Programs - "frameworks" for other programs

These programs are needed to run other programs or scripts. This is mainly used by different developers. If you need them, you will know what program you need without this list.

1. Git Bash <https://git-scm.com/>
2. Java https://www.java.com/
3. Python https://www.python.org/
4. .Net Framework https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
5. Nodejs https://nodejs.org/
6. Adobe Flash Player - now almost never needed
7. Xcode https://developer.apple.com/download/more/

### Useful utility

Programs that do not belong to any Mac tools, not to the mini framework, but can be useful
